## Wbat can Veams do for you?

Veams contains a variety of generators, means you have a lot of flexibility in there. Let's put it in examples: 

1. You want to create a React App with React-Router, Redux, Redux-Observables and RxJS?
1. You want to create a powerful, fast and scalable Static Page App? 
1. You want to scaffold a new project with Webpack 4 or Grunt? 
1. You need a Mock-API with ExpressJS?
1. You want to use Bootstrap, Foundation, Bourbon and Lost to your project?

When you can answer one question with `yeeahh`, then you have found the right tool! You only need to install our lovely CLI. 

## Installation

Be sure you have NodeJS installed. With that in place you can easily install the `cli` via: 

```bash
npm install -g @veams/cli
```
