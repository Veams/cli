## What can Veams do for you?

Veams contains a variety of generators, means you have a lot of flexibility in there. 

Let's put it in examples: 

1. You want to create a React App with React-Router, Redux, Redux-Observables and RxJS?
1. You want to create a powerful, fast and scalable Static Page App?

1. You need a Mock-API with ExpressJS?
